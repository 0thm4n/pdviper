Future development
***************

PDViPeR is still under development and more functions are planned, but it largely depends on available resources in the future.  So the more Users that download and use the software and offer constructive suggestions for improvement will assist the beamline team in securing future resources.  Any comments are welcome and please feel free to feedback your own required features. We will comment on the feasibility and consider them in future developments. For any inquiries, please send to pdviper@synchrotron.org.au
